What is Turbulence?

Turbulence is an utility similar to Chakra's kapudan, that
configures multiple aspects of KDE at first boot. Some of it's
features are:

    -Sleak blue graphical layout
    -Provides information of Manjaro to new users
    -Can allow the user to easily select which Folders he wants in his home directory
    -Allows users to select which theme they want for Kwin
    -Allows users to select which wallpaper they want
    -Can also allow people to open system settings after they've ran through everything else to set any last minute details
    
A roadmap of future changes that are planed are:

    -Multi-Lingual support
    -Multi-Resolution support
    -new pages to access more settings such as:
        -Interaction with firewall KCM module
        -Interaction with touchpad KCM module
    -New stylesheets, such as Manjaro green and grey
    -Fix the Glaring radio boxes, and check boxes when not using the Ozone style sheet
